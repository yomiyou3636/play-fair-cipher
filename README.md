# Vigenère Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This Python script allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using the Vigenère cipher. It includes two separate programs: one for encryption and another for
decryption.

## Encryption

### Usage

To encrypt a plaintext message using the Vigenère cipher, run the `vigenere_encrypt.py` script. Follow the instructions to enter the encryption key
and the plaintext message.

```bash
python play_fair_encryption.py
```

The program will provide you with the corresponding ciphertext.

## Decryption

### Usage

To decrypt a Vigenère ciphertext using the key, run the `vigenere_decrypt.py` script. Follow the instructions to enter the decryption key and the ciphertext.

```bash
python play_fair_decryption.py
```

The program will return the original plaintext.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

## Features

- Supports both encryption and decryption.
- Handles keys of varying lengths.
- Ignores non-alphabet characters in the input text.

## Example

For example, to encrypt the plaintext "HELLO" with the key "KEY," you would run the encryption script and provide the key "KEY" along with the plaintext
"HELLO." The output will be the corresponding ciphertext.

Similarly, to decrypt the ciphertext with the key "KEY," you would run the decryption script, provide the key "KEY," and enter the ciphertext. 
The output will be the original plaintext "HELLO."
